# About Romix #

Romix is a minimalist live Debian-based Linux operating system that consists of a simple OpenBox environment that has all the basic functionality you'd expect on a laptop, such as brightness control, suspend on lid and other things we normally take for granted.

We believe that it is important to have a system that is both secure and is easy to use. We imagined a system that is protected from malware, ransomware, behavior tracking, and hacking. A system that does its best to let you consume, create and protect data, protect you, and protect itself. We decided to build on the idea of resilience - even if a single or multiple components get compromised, they would be automatically restored to pristine state without affecting any data. Hence, the idea of a read-only operating system was born.

We also don't like bloatware and completely unnecessary components that are present in many modern system. This bloatware increases the attack surface and wastes resources. To address that concern, we designed Romix to be a minimalist system.

Romix is fully customizable - you get the basic environment. Add any package you need, build it, burn it, use it.

Romix is based on Debian Live. Thanks to the guys and gals at [the Debian Live project](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-live/) that have produced such an awesome framework for building live systems.

In addition to using Romix as a live system, you can also install Romix as a regular Linux system and it will create a usable minimalist Debian environment for you.
